Chess-Game
==========
Chess-Game is a chessboard game in which a player can play against the computer.
The project currently uses very basic implementation of Alpha-Beta search algorithm
and hence the search takes time that might be more than usual.The evaluation method 
uses very basic evaluation technique to calculate board score.Special moves like 
en-passant,pawn promotion and castling are yet to be covered.


To run the project,either type:
	
	java -jar Chess-Game.jar
	
on the console.Make sure the jar file is present in the current directory of the console.
If you have eclipse,you can import the project in eclipse and run it.


Things that need improvements:

	* Special moves will be included in the game.

	* Board evaluation will be improved.

	* Search algorithm will be improved.
